The SSD-3500 utilizes advanced ProSound technologies, such as fully digital beam former, wide dynamic range, 12-bit A/D converter, and multi beam processing, to deliver clear and detailed images of the anatomy. It also features Quint Frequency Imaging, which allows you to select up to five transmission frequencies for each transducer, and Tissue Harmonic Echo, which enhances contrast resolution and reduces noise.
 
The SSD-3500 is also designed with ergonomics, user-friendliness, and mobility in mind. It has a simple and intuitive interface that enables you to customize the system according to your specific needs. It also has a compact and lightweight body that can be easily transported and stored. The SSD-3500 is compatible with a wide range of specialty transducers, including linear, convex, phased array, endocavity, and intraoperative probes.
 
If you are looking for a reliable and powerful ultrasound system for musculoskeletal imaging, the Aloka SSD-3500 is a great choice. You can find more information about the SSD-3500 on the official website of Aloka[^1^], or download the service manual[^2^] [^3^] for technical details.
  
The SSD-3500 is equipped with a 15-inch high-resolution monitor that displays images in real-time and allows you to adjust the brightness, contrast, and color settings. It also has a built-in hard disk drive that can store up to 40,000 images and a CD-RW drive that can export images and data to external media. The SSD-3500 supports DICOM 3.0 standard for network communication and data exchange with other devices.
 
The SSD-3500 offers various imaging modes and functions to enhance your diagnostic capabilities. You can use B-mode, M-mode, color Doppler, power Doppler, pulsed wave Doppler, continuous wave Doppler, and duplex mode to visualize different aspects of the anatomy and blood flow. You can also use Dual Dynamic Display to compare two images side by side, angular M-mode to measure the motion of structures at different angles, and real-time 3D/4D imaging to obtain volumetric data and render realistic images of the anatomy.
 
The SSD-3500 is compatible with Aloka's exclusive software packages that provide additional features and functions for specific applications. For example, you can use ProSound Alpha 10 for advanced cardiac imaging, ProSound Alpha 7 for obstetrics and gynecology imaging, ProSound Alpha 5 for general imaging, and ProSound Alpha 3 for veterinary imaging. These software packages can be easily installed and updated on the SSD-3500.
