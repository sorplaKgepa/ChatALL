1. First, you need to get a copy of Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction. You can buy it from Blizzard's online store or use a torrent site to download it. If you choose the latter option, make sure you have a torrent client like uTorrent or BitTorrent installed on your Mac.
2. Next, you need to mount the ISO files of Diablo 2 and Lord of Destruction using a program like Daemon Tools Lite or Virtual CloneDrive. These programs will create virtual CD drives on your Mac that will allow you to run the game installer.
3. Then, you need to install Diablo 2 and Lord of Destruction on your Mac. Follow the instructions on the screen and enter the CD keys when prompted. You can find the CD keys on the back of the game case or in the torrent file.
4. After that, you need to patch the game to the latest version. You can do this by running the Blizzard Launcher app that comes with the game or by downloading the patch manually from Blizzard's website. The latest version as of this writing is 1.14d.
5. Finally, you need to run the game in compatibility mode. This is because Diablo 2 is a 32-bit app that may not work well on newer Macs with 64-bit operating systems. To do this, right-click on the Diablo 2 app icon and select "Get Info". Then, check the box that says "Open in Low Resolution Mode" and "Open using Rosetta". This will make the game run smoother and prevent crashes.

Now that you have Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction running on your Mac, you might want to know some tips and tricks to make your gameplay more enjoyable and efficient. Here are some of them:

- Use the /players command to adjust the difficulty and experience gain. This command only works offline, and it allows you to simulate playing with more players in the game. The more players, the harder the enemies and the more experience and loot they drop. To use this command, hit the ENTER button and type /players followed by a number from 1 to 8. For example, /players 8 will make the game as hard as playing with 7 other players.
- Use the Horadric Cube to transmute items and create new ones. The Horadric Cube is a special item that can be found in Act II. It has four slots that can be filled with various items to create new ones. For example, putting three gems of the same type and quality will result in one gem of a higher quality. There are many recipes for the Horadric Cube that can be found online or discovered by trial and error.
- Maximize your resistances to elemental damage. In Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction, your character has four resistances: fire, cold, lightning, and poison. These resistances reduce the damage you take from those elements. Having high resistances is crucial for surviving in higher difficulties, where enemies deal more elemental damage and your resistances are lowered by default. You can increase your resistances by wearing gear that has resistance bonuses, using charms that have resistance bonuses, or completing certain quests that grant resistance rewards.

These are just some of the tips and tricks that can help you in Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction. There are many more secrets and strategies to discover as you explore the world of Sanctuary and fight against the forces of evil. Have fun!
